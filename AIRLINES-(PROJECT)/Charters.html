    Charter airlines operate flights that are not part of the standard, scheduled airline routes. Instead, they provide customized air travel, where an individual or group charters an entire aircraft for their specific needs, including the route, schedule, and onboard services. This contrasts with commercial airlines that offer pre-set routes and schedules for individual ticket purchases. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
Key characteristics of charter airlines: 
Non-scheduled flights:
Charter flights are not part of the regular, published flight schedules that airlines maintain. 
Customized travel:
Chartering allows for flexible scheduling, destinations, and even onboard amenities tailored to the client's preferences. 
Private or Public Charters:
Charter flights can be private, meaning the entire aircraft is booked by a single entity, or public, where a tour operator might charter an aircraft to offer flights to specific destinations, often seasonally.
