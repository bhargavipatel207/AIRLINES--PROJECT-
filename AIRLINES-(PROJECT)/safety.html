    <ul><li>    Aviation safety is the study and practice of managing risks in aviation. This includes preventing aviation accidents and incidents through research, educating air travel personnel, passengers and the general public, as well as the design of aircraft and aviation infrastructure. The aviation industry is subject to significant regulations and oversight.</li>

Air travel is statistically very safe, becoming even safer over time. While the dramatic nature of plane crashes can cause fear, the reality is that the odds of dying in a plane crash are extremely low, and much lower than other common causes of death. Modern technology, improved regulations, and rigorous training for flight crews and air traffic controllers have all contributed to this increased safety.</li>
