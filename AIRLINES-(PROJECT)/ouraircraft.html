<h3>Airlines and aircraft: a Wikipedia overview </h3></h1>

<ul>
       <li>Narrow-body airliners (single-aisle):</li><span> Used for short to medium-distance flights with fewer passengers. Examples include the Airbus A320 family and Boeing 737.</span><br><br>

       <li>Wide-body airliners (twin-aisle): </li><span> Used for longer flights between major hubs and cities. Examples include the Boeing 747, Airbus A380, Boeing 787, and Airbus A350.</span><br><br>
       <li>Regional aircraft:</li><span>Smaller aircraft, often with fewer than 100 passengers, that can be powered by turbofans or turboprops. These aircraft connect smaller cities to larger airline hubs.</span><br><br>
       <li>Commuter aircraft: </li><span>Even smaller regional airliners or air taxis, typically seating a small number of passengers (e.g., the Beechcraft 1900 with 19 seats).</span>
    </ul>
    An aircraft is a vehicle capable of flight, supported by the air through either static lift (like balloons) or dynamic lift (like airplanes). It encompasses a wide range of machines, including airplanes, helicopters, airships, and gliders. Airplanes, specifically, are fixed-wing aircraft propelled by engines. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
<h2>Key Components of Aircraft:</h2>

<ul><li>Fuselage:</li> The main body of the aircraft, housing the crew, passengers, and cargo. 

 <li> Wings:</li> Generate lift, allowing the aircraft to stay airborne. 

<li>Tail Assembly:</li> Provides stability and control, often including elevators and rudders. 
Landing Gear: Supports the aircraft on the ground during takeoff and landing. 

<li>Engines:</li> Provide the thrust needed to move the aircraft forward. 
<li>Cockpit:</li> The area where the pilot controls the aircraft. 
Principles of Flight:</ul>
<h3>Major manufacturers</h3> 
The airliner market is primarily controlled by Airbus and Boeing. Regional airliners are manufactured by companies such as ATR Aircraft, De Havilland Canada, and Embraer. Other manufacturers of large airliners include Antonov, Comac, Irkut Corporation, and Xian Aircraft Industrial Corporation.
